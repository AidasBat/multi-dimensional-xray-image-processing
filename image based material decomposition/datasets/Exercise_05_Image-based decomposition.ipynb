    "The last two weeks, we concentrated on material decomposition approaches based on projection images. The other approach is to perform the decomposition using the already reconstructed images which contain information about the local attenuation coefficient $\\mu$. The advantage is a less complicated decomposition approach based on the tabulated values for $\\mu$ without the need for calibration measurements. In this exercise, we will walk through such a decomposition. As reminder: For a sample containing two materials 1 and 2 in volume fractions of $n_1$ and $n_2$ the following expression for the total attenuation coefficient $\\mu_{tot}$ is valid\n",
