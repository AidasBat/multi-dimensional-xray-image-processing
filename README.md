# Multi-dimensional xray image processing
A collection of image processing exercises completed during my quantitative xray course at the Technical University of Munich (TUM). This repository contains hands-on implementations of various image processing concepts, including filtering, edge detection, and morphological operations. The exercises were conducted using scipy.ndimage, numpy, and pandas for data manipulation, with visualizations created using matplotlib to analyze and interpret the results effectively. Each exercise is structured as a Jupyter Notebook, complete with explanations, visualizations, and reproducible code.

## 📌 Topics Covered:  

✔️ Basic image data manipulation  
✔️ Xray interaction data analysis  
✔️ Xray image based material decomposition  
✔️ Xray projection based material decomposition  
✔️ Propagation based phase retrieval  
✔️ Speckle based imaging analysis with UMPA  
✔️ Wave propagation and coherence
